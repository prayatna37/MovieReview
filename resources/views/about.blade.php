					<p>MovieReview is a platform for entertainment journalism. Our main focus is film – Bollywood, Hollywood, world cinema. We provide a collection of reviews from various professional reviewrs on a single movie helping viewers get more idea on a certain toopic. We also have the functionality to give the opportunity for the users to share their view from their perspective on the movie and hold discussions.
                        lm Companion provides conversation and curation around the content – so if you need a review of the latest movie released or how users react to th movie, you come to MovieReview.
                        We wont post reviews aboyt Gossip, paid reviews or celeb lifestyle journalism. So we will carry a feature on how essential and powerful stylists have become but we won’t carry photos of what Sonam wore to an award function.
                        We celebrate good content and the men and women who ccontribute to it.

                    <p> Our Motto comes from a line by the American philosopher Stanley Cavell who said: The writing about film that has meant most to me has the power of a missing companion. We aim to be the missing companion for smart people who like good content.
                        MovieReview is for lovers of good content. Our main aim is to ensuare that users or the movie-goers have full infomration about the movie before investing time and resourcves in watching the movie.
